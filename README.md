This project is an introduction to using React.js for extracting data from an API. It focuses on:

- Making API requests in order to retrieve JSON data.
- Creating event handling functions for forms.
- Updating of Components and their State.
- Passing of State values as Props between Components.
- Using React lifecycle methods (such as componentDidUpdate()) to check for updates made to the State of Components.
